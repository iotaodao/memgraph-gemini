Memgraph is a high-performance graph database compatible with Neo4j. 
It is engineered to run in-memory, which provides extremely low latency for real-time applications.
Memgraph supports the Cypher query language and integrates seamlessly with AI tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex.
One of its key features is native support for vector search (using cosine similarity), allowing developers to build Hybrid RAG systems.
Memgraph is implemented in C++ and is often used for fraud detection, recommendation engines, and network analysis.
